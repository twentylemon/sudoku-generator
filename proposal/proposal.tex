    The purpose of this project will be to generate minimal sudoku puzzles. A minimal sudoku puzzle is one with the least possible
    number of given values where the puzzle only has one solution. These puzzles should be the hardest possible sudokus.
    The project will explore different ways of generating these sudoku puzzles, as well as explore some ways to solve sudoku puzzles
    quickly as the generation will inherently require being able to solve sudokus.
